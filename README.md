# Ripple

Ripple is a **meditation** app that I worked on.  My motivation is to let highschoolers use Ripple to meditate for a few minutes everyday and become more mindful. Mindfulness meditation not only helps relieve stress but also helps ease depression and anxiety.  The best time to meditate is in the morning.  You can spend 5-10 minutes on meditating with Ripple after a hot morning shower.  When meditating, try concentrate on your breath and stop your mind when it wanders.  Try to do this every morning and do it consistently four or five times per week. You'll experience the power of medititation and start your school day with fresh mind everyday.
